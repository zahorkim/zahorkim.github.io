Hello, my name is Jaeho Kim, and I am currently pursuing a bachelor's degree at Kyung Hee University with a double major in Computer Science and Sports Coaching. My academic journey has been driven by a strong passion for the intersection of technology and human performance, which has led me to explore diverse fields that bridge these disciplines.

Currently, I am an undergraduate researcher at the AIR Lab, where I engage in projects that align with my deep interest in Computer Vision and Robotics. I am particularly fascinated by how intelligent systems can perceive and interact with the real world, and I am eager to contribute to advancements in these fields through innovative research and development.
